## What it says on the tin

> Years ago, Developers had problems and devised Agile techniques to address them. Today, Desingers face similar problems. Can we adopt similar techniques? In this talk, we’ll explore what automated testing might look like for design. What would it look like to have a more defined definition of “done” for design? What if designers could refactor with impunity? We’ll explore testing possibilities for Visual design, User Experience design, and front-end engineering, and try to build a testing pyramid for design.

and so devised
.em[automated testing techniques]
